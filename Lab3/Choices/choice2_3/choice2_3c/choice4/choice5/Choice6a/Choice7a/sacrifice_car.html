    <h1>No more car Barbara!</h1>
    <p>
	A determined glint in your eye, you shift into action, preparing for a sacrificial 	maneuver.

	Before abandoning the relative safety of the car, you rev the engine, the roar 	cutting through the eerie silence of the tunnel. The noise attracts the attention 	of the approaching horde, drawing them closer to the source of the sound. In a 	heartbeat, you release the brake, and the car hurtles forward with unbridled force.

	The impact is visceral, the car colliding with the mass of zombies, creating a 	grotesque spectacle of bodies tumbling and limbs flailing. The relentless undead, 	drawn to the noise, swarm around the vehicle like a ravenous sea. The windows 	shatter, and the interior is flooded with grasping hands and gnashing teeth.

	Seizing the opportunity, you act quickly, pulling your children out of the car and 	into the relative safety of the tunnel's dimly lit surroundings. The echoing moans 	of the undead provide an unsettling soundtrack to your escape, the tunnel now a 	battleground between the relentless horde and the remnants of your once-protected 	vehicle.

	As you watch the car become engulfed by the writhing mass of zombies, a mix of 	sorrow and relief washes over you. The sacrifice of the car has created a temporary 	opening, a narrow pathway through the undead that allows you and your children to 	slip past the chaotic scene.

	You guide your children through the macabre landscape, the scent of decay and the 	distant sounds of the undead serving as a constant reminder of the peril that 	surrounds you. The tunnel, once a symbol of potential entrapment, becomes a 	fleeting reprieve, a passageway to an uncertain future.

	You emerge from the other end of the tunnel.
