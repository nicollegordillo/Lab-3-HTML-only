	The engine roars, and the car surges forward into the approaching sea of zombies. 	However, the sheer number of undead proves overwhelming. The vehicle collides with 	the first wave of bodies, the impact shaking the car and creating a gruesome 	spectacle as limbs and torsos are thrown aside.

	Despite your efforts to power through, the relentless tide of zombies proves 	insurmountable. The car comes to a jolting stop, wedged between the relentless undead 	and the tunnel exit. The windows shatter under the relentless assault, and grasping 	hands reach inside, clawing at the interior.

	Panic sets in as the once-protective shell of the car is breached. In a desperate bid 	to shield your children, you gather them close, the echoes of their terrified breaths 	mingling with the cacophony of the undead. The world outside the shattered windows 	transforms into a nightmarish tableau, with grasping hands and hungry mouths reaching 	for you and your family.
