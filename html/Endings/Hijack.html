    	<h1>Zombie Baby Barbara!</h1>
    </header>
    <p>
	With the tunnel now behind you, the urgency to escape the immediate threat propels you forward. The realization that you need a new mode of transportation takes hold, and your eyes scan the dimly lit surroundings for a potential solution. A lone car sits nearby, seemingly abandoned, its windows tinted with an air of mystery.

With a calculated sense of desperation, you approach the car, assessing it for signs of life. Peering through the windows, you see no movement inside, and a spark of hope ignites. This vehicle could be your ticket to a faster escape, a means to outrun the encroaching dangers.

With a tense breath, you reach for the door handle and pull it open. The initial stillness is broken as a figure, obscured by the shadows within the car, suddenly lunges toward you. The sight freezes you in place for a split second, and as the dim light filters into the vehicle, the horrifying truth becomes clearâ€”a zombie baby, small but relentless, is the unexpected occupant.

In the blink of an eye, the zombie baby clamps onto your arm, its tiny but surprisingly strong hands gnashing at your flesh. Panic courses through your veins as you wrestle with the unexpected threat. The cries of the undead infant mix with your own startled exclamations, creating a dissonant symphony in the dimly lit surroundings.
