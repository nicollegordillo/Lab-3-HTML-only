    <h1>You can always make more Barbara!</h1>
    <p>
	The weight of the decision to sacrifice your daughter, driven by the grim reality of survival, settles like a heavy shroud around your shoulders. In the midst of the undead-ridden world, where each moment is a perilous dance with death, you continue the journey with your son. The haunted echoes of your daughter's absence linger, a silent testament to the unforgiving choices demanded by the apocalypse.

As you approach the shelter, guarded by vigilant soldiers, the air becomes charged with a mix of anxiety and anticipation. Your son, sensing the gravity of the situation, clings to your side. The soldiers, their faces etched with a combination of weariness and duty, scrutinize your approach. The possibility of infection, even in the form of eczema, adds an extra layer of tension to the encounter.

With a furrowed brow, one of the soldiers steps forward, scrutinizing your son for any signs of infection. Your heart pounds as you hold your breath, hoping that the sacrifice made earlier will not be in vain. After a tense moment, the soldier nods, signaling to the others that you are not a threat. The gate to the shelter creaks open, offering a sanctuary from the relentless dangers outside.

Entering the shelter, the atmosphere shifts from the harshness of the exterior to the cool, sterile confines within. The soldiers guide you through the labyrinthine passages, and a sense of relief washes over you as the shelter becomes a haven from the horrors that lurk beyond its fortified walls.

Finally, you reunite with your husband in the shelter. His eyes, once filled with anticipation, now register a mix of relief and trepidation as he scans the faces of the arrivals. The absence of your daughter does not go unnoticed, and a heavy silence settles over the reunion.

"Where is she?" he inquires, his voice a whispered plea. The weight of the unspoken truth hangs in the air, and your son, unable to bear the burden of the secret any longer, steps forward.

"She... she didn't make it," he confesses, the words heavy with the sorrow of the truth. The revelation is met with a stunned silence, and your husband's eyes widen with a mix of grief and realization.

The shelter, once a refuge promising safety and reunion, becomes a bittersweet sanctuary. The sacrifice made for survival casts a long shadow over the family, leaving you safe but haunted by the ghosts of choices made in the crucible of the apocalypse.
