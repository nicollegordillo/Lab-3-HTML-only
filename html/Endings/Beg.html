	The desperate pleas for mercy fall on deaf ears as the group of survivors remains resolute in their decision, they mistake your daughters eczema for a zombie bite. The harsh reality of the apocalyptic world becomes brutally apparent—trust is a rare commodity, and compassion often takes a backseat to the instinct for self-preservation. Tearfully, you bid farewell to your daughter, left with no choice but to continue the journey with your son.

The path to the shelter is fraught with anxiety, the shadows of the recent encounter with the survivors looming over your every step. As you approach the shelter, guarded by vigilant soldiers, the knot in your stomach tightens. The weight of the truth—of sacrificing one for the sake of the others—hangs heavy in the air.

The soldiers, clad in military attire, scrutinize your son for any signs of infection. The seconds stretch into an agonizing eternity as the soldiers assess the risk. A silent exchange passes between them, and then, with a nod, the gate creaks open.

Relief floods over you as the soldiers permit entry into the shelter. The fortified walls offer a brief respite from the dangers outside, and the dimly lit corridors become a sanctuary from the harshness of the apocalyptic world.

Upon reuniting with your husband, the air is thick with a mixture of joy and grief. His eyes, scanning the faces of the returning survivors, widen with the realization that one is missing. As you approach, the unspeakable truth dawns upon him, and a wave of anguish washes over his features.

"Where is she?" he asks, his voice a tremor of anxiety. The heaviness of the revelation settles between you, and you find the strength to utter the words.

"She didn't make it," you confess, your voice breaking under the weight of the painful truth. The shelter, which should have been a haven of safety, becomes a somber backdrop to the shared grief of losing a family member in the relentless struggle for survival.

Your husband, though devastated by the news, recognizes the harsh realities that define the world outside. His gaze, filled with a mix of sorrow and understanding, meets yours. In the silent exchange, there is acknowledgment—acknowledgment of the sacrifices made, of the unbearable choices that shape existence in this unforgiving landscape.
