	In the dimming twilight, the reality of your son's impending transformation hangs heavy in the air. As the car rumbles through the desolate landscape, you glance at your son in the rearview mirror, his innocent eyes reflecting a future tainted by the inevitability of the undead.

The decision to spare him from the horrors of transformation becomes an unbearable weight on your shoulders. The handgun, nestled in the glove box, becomes a harbinger of mercy in the face of impending tragedy. A sense of urgency grips you, pushing you to confront the unthinkable before reaching the supposed safety of the shelter.

Finding a secluded spot by the roadside, you guide your son away from the sheltered gaze of your daughter. The muted sounds of the deserted world echo around you as you share a final, wordless moment with him. The handgun, cold and unforgiving, is retrieved from its temporary hiding place.

Tears blur your vision as you steady the firearm. Your son, sensing the gravity of the situation, looks at you with a mixture of confusion and trust. In the agonizing seconds that follow, the resounding shot shatters the quietude, the weight of the sacrifice settling heavily on your shoulders.

The lifeless form of your son crumples to the ground, the echoes of the gunshot reverberating through the desolate surroundings. The reality of the choice made, a mother sacrificing her own blood for the sake of mercy, hangs in the air like a haunting specter.

As you return to the car, the glove box once again conceals the handgun, now a silent witness to the tragedy that unfolded by the roadside. The journey to the shelter continues, but the shadows within the car are cast longer by the unspoken grief.

Reaching the shelter, the uncharted territories of deception and sacrifice lay bare the harsh truths of this apocalyptic world. The soldiers at the entrance remain unaware of the desperate act committed on the roadside. The shelter, once a beacon of hope, becomes a sanctuary overshadowed by the silent echoes of a mother's impossible choice, a sacrifice made in the cold embrace of a world overrun by the undead.
