The decision to stay within the confines of your house, despite the gnawing fear and the haunting sense that the worst has already befallen your children, is a chilling acknowledgment of a mother's deepest fears. The walls of your home, once a sanctuary, now seem like the only buffer between you and the nightmarish reality that has unfolded outside.

Inside, the atmosphere is heavy with dread. Every creak of the floorboards and rustle of the curtains feels amplified as you navigate the familiar spaces, seeking solace in the perceived safety of your own haven. The walls, adorned with family photographs and memories, offer a bittersweet comfort, a stark reminder of the life that has been abruptly shattered.

Yet, nothing could have prepared you for the sudden chaos that erupts from the backyard. The once-tranquil outdoor space, a retreat for laughter and barbecues, has transformed into a haunting battleground. Through the windows, you witness the unthinkable – your neighbors, now reduced to soulless zombies, relentlessly pounding on the glass doors.

Panic tightens its grip as the once-familiar faces now bear the vacant, lifeless gaze of the undead. The backyard, once a shared communal space, is now a haunting theater where the horrors of the epidemic unfold. The relentless pounding becomes a macabre symphony, a dissonant melody that reverberates through the house, amplifying the sense of impending doom.

As the neighbors-turned-zombies intensify their assault, cracks begin to spiderweb across the glass doors. The chilling reality sets in – the perceived safety of your home is crumbling before your eyes. Desperation surges within as you scramble to reinforce the barricades, hoping against hope that they will withstand the relentless onslaught.

But the inevitable happens. The glass doors, once a barrier between the living and the undead, give way under the relentless force. The shattering sound is a gut-wrenching reminder that the sanctuary you sought has been breached, and the nightmare you had hoped to keep at bay is now crashing through the threshold.
