Horrified and fearing the worst, you push open the door to the unlocked classroom. The once-sterile environment now greets you with an unsettling sight—blood smeared across desks, streaked along the floor, and splattered on the walls. Your heart pounds in your chest as a chilling silence envelops the room, punctuated only by the haunting creak of a swinging door.

Your eyes follow the macabre trail of blood, each step heightening the dread that gnaws at your insides. The stark realization hits you—this is not just a chaotic aftermath; something unimaginable has taken place. You steel yourself against the rising panic as you navigate the gruesome scene, the sickening scent of iron hanging heavy in the air.

As you follow the crimson trail, the source of the horror unfolds. In a corner of the classroom, you witness a haunting tableau—a group of zombie children, their faces contorted with an eerie vacant stare. The once vibrant innocence that filled these young souls has been replaced by an insatiable hunger, and their movements, now disjointed and erratic, send a shiver down your spine.

Torn between sorrow and terror, you grapple with the nightmarish reality. The room, once a space for learning and laughter, is now a gruesome stage for the undead. Your motherly instinct urges you to retreat, to escape the horrifying scene before you, but an unrelenting curiosity compels you to understand the extent of the tragedy.

As you inch closer, the zombie children sense your presence. Their lifeless eyes lock onto you, and a collective growl emanates from their tiny, undead forms. The juxtaposition of innocence and horror is jarring, and the room seems to close in as the unsettling reality sinks in.

With a heavy heart, you force yourself to turn away, leaving the room haunted by the ghostly echoes of a once-thriving classroom.
