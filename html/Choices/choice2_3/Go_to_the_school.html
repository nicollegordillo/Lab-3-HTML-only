	As you grip the steering wheel with a mix of determination and trepidation, the once-familiar streets that lead to the school have transformed into a nightmarish tableau. The rhythmic hum of the engine provides an unsettling soundtrack to the scenes unfolding outside your car window. The serene suburban landscape has given way to an apocalyptic panorama, where the living dead roam freely, their eerie silhouettes contrasting against the backdrop of what was once a tranquil neighborhood.

As you navigate through the maze of abandoned cars and shuffling figures, a surreal realization settles in â€“ the idyllic streets that once framed your daily routine have become a battleground for survival. The undead, with vacant eyes and ominous moans, stagger aimlessly, their presence turning the familiar into a dystopian nightmare.

Your eyes dart nervously from one side of the street to the other, scanning for safe passage amid the throng of undead. It's a surreal dance as you maneuver through the once-bustling intersections, each turn a calculated gamble to avoid the encroaching hordes. The once-ordinary houses that lined the streets now cast long shadows, and the quaint neighborhood school, your destination, seems like a distant sanctuary in the midst of this harrowing ordeal.

The radio crackles with emergency broadcasts, warning survivors to seek shelter and avoid unnecessary risks. The urgency in the disembodied voice only adds to the weight of the situation, heightening your anxiety as you navigate through the now-deserted streets.

Despite the surreal horror unfolding outside, you push forward, determined to reach the school and ensure the safety of your loved ones. The once-predictable suburban drive becomes a nerve-wracking odyssey, a test of survival in a world that has unraveled at an alarming pace. The echoes of moans and distant chaos serve as a grim reminder that the quaint neighborhood you once called home is now a battleground where every street poses a potential threat.

You reach the school after what feels like an eternity. Searching for your kids, you notice that most clases are empty or locked, limiting the places your kids could be at.
