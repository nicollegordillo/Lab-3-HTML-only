With trepidation coursing through your veins, you cautiously step into the nurse's office, the sterile smell of antiseptic lingering in the air. The room, once a place of healing and comfort, now feels eerily silent and ominous. The flickering fluorescent lights cast unsettling shadows across the medical paraphernalia scattered about, heightening the tension that lingers in the air.

As you scan the room for any sign of your children, a disconcerting sight catches your eye. Huddled in the corner, a figure in a tattered nurse's uniform shuffles towards you with a hauntingly slow gait. The once compassionate eyes are now glazed over, and an unnerving growl escapes her lips as she recognizes your presence.

Fear grips your chest, but your motherly instincts kick in. You swiftly navigate the room, narrowly avoiding the lunging attempts of the zombie nurse. The unsettling realization dawns that this once-carer has succumbed to the same fate that has befallen so many. Panic sets in as you search for a means to neutralize the immediate threat.

Spotting a janitorial closet nearby, you seize the opportunity. With a surge of adrenaline, you skillfully sidestep the advancing zombie nurse and maneuver her towards the closet. In a desperate push, you manage to redirect her stumbling form into the confined space. The thud of the door closing echoes through the otherwise silent nurse's office, and you swiftly secure it, trapping the zombie nurse inside, but maybe not for long.
