	As you prepare to embark on the journey to the military shelter, a sense of 	determination guides your actions. Before starting the car, you reach into the 	glove box, retrieving a worn map. The creases on its surface tell the tales of 	previous journeys, but now, it holds the potential to guide your family to safety.

	With a pen in hand, you meticulously mark what appears to be the fastest route to 	the shelter. Each intersection, highway, and landmark becomes a vital waypoint on 	the map, a lifeline in the chaos that surrounds you. The plan is set, and with a 	deep breath, you set the car in motion, the engine roaring to life in response to 	your decisive action.

	As you approach the designated route, the gravity of the situation becomes evident. 	The streets, once bustling with life, now stretch before you as eerily quiet 	corridors. The echoes of distant moans and the occasional shuffling figure cast an 	unsettling atmosphere over the journey. However, your focus remains on the path 	marked on the map, a route that promises safety and a reunion with your husband.

	Upon reaching what was supposed to be the fastest route, a chilling realization 	sets inâ€”it's blocked. A barricade of abandoned cars and debris obstructs the road, 	rendering your planned path impassable. Panic flares for a moment, but you take a 	steadying breath, surveying the scene with a determined resolve.

	Now faced with an unexpected obstacle, you find yourself at a crossroads. The 		urgency of the situation demands a quick decision. Three options lay before you, 	each with its own set of challenges and uncertainties.
