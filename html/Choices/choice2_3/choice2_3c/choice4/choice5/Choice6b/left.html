	The decision to turn left leads you into uncharted territories, the road ahead shrouded in uncertainty. The tires crunch on gravel as the car ventures deeper into the unknown, each passing moment fraught with the tension of the unpredictable world outside.

As you navigate through the unfamiliar landscape, your gaze flickers to the rear-view mirror, instinctively checking on your children. A pang of anxiety tightens your chest when you notice an unsettling sight â€“ your son, sitting in the backseat, has a telltale bite mark on his arm. The revelation hits you like a physical blow, the gravity of the situation sinking in.

Panic surges, but you fight to maintain composure. Your grip on the steering wheel tightens as a torrent of emotions swirl within you. Beside you, your daughter senses the shift in atmosphere, her eyes wide with fear and confusion.

With a heavy heart, you pull the car to a stop, the gravel crunching beneath the tires. The world outside seems to hold its breath as you turn to face your son. His eyes, once filled with innocence, now reflect a mixture of fear and acceptance.

"What happened?" you ask, your voice trembling as you examine the bite. The reality of the situation settles heavily upon the confined space of the car. Your son, aware of the grim fate that often accompanies a bite, looks at you with a somber expression.

"I got too close to one of them," he admits, his voice barely a whisper. The weight of his words hangs in the air, a stark reminder of the dangers that lurk in the shadows of this apocalyptic world.
