	The journey on foot continues, your children keeping pace with a resilience that mirrors your own determination. The streets, once teeming with life, now echo with a haunting silence that seems to amplify the sound of every footfall. Shadows cast by skeletal remnants of buildings stretch across the path, underscoring the desolation that surrounds you.

As you navigate through the desolate landscape, a flicker of hope ignites within you. In the distance, you catch sight of movementâ€”figures that don't shuffle or stumble like the undead but move with purpose. Relief washes over you at the thought of encountering fellow survivors. The possibility of shared resources, camaraderie, and shared burdens sparks a glimmer of optimism in your worn heart.

Approaching cautiously, you and your children draw near to the group of survivors. Tattered clothing, weary expressions, and makeshift weapons are the defining features of this band of individuals who, like you, have endured the unthinkable. The shared silence speaks volumes, a language born of shared trauma and resilience.

However, the momentary sense of relief shatters like glass as the group suddenly notices you and your children. In an instant, weapons are drawn, and the survivors fix their gaze on your family with a mixture of suspicion and fear. The harsh reality of this new world comes crashing down as their eyes focus not on the weary faces of your children, but on the fear that you might be infected.

"Hold it right there!" one of the survivors commands, their voice laced with caution and distrust. The barrels of their weapons point directly at your family, the collective decision to prioritize survival over trust evident in their unyielding stance.

Panic sets in as you raise your hands in a futile attempt to convey that you pose no threat. "We're not infected! We're just trying to survive like you," you plead, your voice carrying the weight of desperation and frustration. The children, sensing the tension, cling to you, wide-eyed and confused.
