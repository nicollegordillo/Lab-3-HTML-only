    <h1>Your babies Barbara!</h1>
    <p>
Relief washes over you as you enter the school gym and catch sight of your two children huddled together behind the bleachers. The tension that had gripped your heart since the outbreak began finally starts to loosen its hold. Their eyes, wide with a mix of fear and uncertainty, meet yours, and a wave of reassurance passes between you.

"Mom!" your youngest exclaims, rushing into your arms, while your older child, equally relieved, manages a faint but grateful smile. The echo of distant moans and unsettling sounds from other parts of the school reminds you that the safety you currently feel is fragile and temporary.

Despite the urgency to leave the eerie confines of the school, a sense of relief envelops you. The gym, once a lively space filled with the echoes of cheers and the squeak of sneakers on the basketball court, now stands as an unlikely sanctuary in the midst of chaos. The sight of your children, seemingly unharmed, becomes the anchor in the storm of uncertainty.

With a quiet determination, you guide your children out from their hiding place behind the bleachers. As a family, you navigate through the dimly lit hallways, avoiding the unsettling sounds that echo from the shadows. The decision to head home becomes a collective missionâ€”a journey towards familiarity and safety.
