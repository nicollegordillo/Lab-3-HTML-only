	As the realization sets in that you've unwittingly barricaded the only exit from the grocery store, panic tightens its grip on your chest. The aisles, once orderly and familiar, now feel like a labyrinth closing in around you. The urgency of the situation propels you into action, and you begin frantically dismantling the makeshift barricade, your hands shaking as you work.

However, your desperate attempts do not go unnoticed. Other shoppers, equally terrified by the encroaching threat, start to notice your actions. Frenzied whispers and anxious glances are exchanged, and some brave souls attempt to restrain you, their panicked voices pleading for you to reconsider. It's a chaotic scene, a microcosm of survival instincts clashing in the face of the supernatural menace pounding at the glass doors.

The distant but growing roars of the undead outside intensify, a stark reminder of the impending danger. The glass doors rattle under the relentless assault, and the urgency of your task becomes increasingly evident. The once-cozy grocery store, now a battleground, echoes with the chaos of the desperate struggle within.

Against the protests of those around you, you continue to dismantle the barricade, fueled by a primal instinct to get to your children. The air is thick with tension, and the sound of distant screams from fellow shoppers reaches your ears. The collective fear intensifies, creating a dissonant symphony that mirrors the surreal nightmare unfolding within the store.

With a final, desperate tug, you manage to create just enough space to slip through. The realization dawns that, in your haste, you've opened a gateway for the undead. The glass doors, once a barrier between safety and chaos, now stand vulnerable to the approaching menace.

Ignoring the horrified cries behind you, you dash through the opening, leaving the remaining shoppers to confront the escalating nightmare within. The distant screams reverberate as you sprint toward the parking lot. Every step away from the grocery store feels like a reprieve, but the haunting awareness of the consequences lingers in the back of your mind.

Reaching your car, you throw yourself inside, the engine roaring to life with a sense of urgency that matches the pounding of your heart.
