        With adrenaline coursing through your veins, the instinct to confront the unexpected terror takes hold. Without second-guessing, you pivot on your heels and sprint back towards the entrance of the grocery store. The once-familiar sliding glass doors now loom ahead like a portal to safety, albeit tinged with an unsettling uncertainty.

As you burst through the entrance, the automatic doors whooshing behind you, the disconcerting sounds of the supernatural encounter intensify. The grocery store, once a mundane backdrop for daily necessities, has transformed into a surreal battleground. The overhead lights flicker ominously, casting erratic shadows across the aisles, amplifying the sense of urgency that propels you forward.

You navigate the aisles with a mix of fear and determination, the echo of your footsteps mingling with the distant growls and desperate cries. A quick glance around reveals that other shoppers share your sentiment, seeking refuge within the store's confines. Wide-eyed faces reflect a collective realization that the once ordinary grocery run has taken an otherworldly turn. In this surreal environment, camaraderie forms among strangers united by the need to escape the encroaching threat.

The checkout counters, usually bustling with the mundane transactions of daily life, now serve as makeshift barricades. Cautiously, you join others in fortifying the entrance, each person contributing to the impromptu defense against the unknown menace. The sense of community, born out of shared fear, creates an unspoken alliance in the face of the undead, when suddenly you remember, YOUR KIDS!.
